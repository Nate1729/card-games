# Sueca

## Background
Sueca is 4 player, trick-taking card game. Wikipedia even claims that it is the national card game of Portugal.
The game is played in teams with players sitting across from one-another. It is important to not that unlike
many other trick-taking card games sueca is palyed anti-clockwise (to the right). Also, sueca only uses a 40-card
deck (8,9,10 removed in each suit, no jokers).

Every hand/round always follows the same steps:
* Shuffle
* Cut
* Deal
* Play
* Score

## Shuffling
Decide who will be the first dealer in what ever way the players decided. A common tactic is to deal one card
to each player and the highest card deals first. After the dealer is chosen the cards are shuffled by the 
player to the dealer's right.

## Cut
After the player is done shuffling the cards his/her teammate (the person to the *left* of the dealer)
cuts the deck. The player may also choose to **not** cut the deck, this is commonly indicated by tapping
the top of the deck.

## Dealing
After the cards have been cut the dealer may start dealing. They are not allowed to cut or shuffle the
cards in any way. There are two ways the cards are allowed to be dealt. Method 1 is to deal, 
anti-clockwise, 10 cards to each player and the last card in the deck is flipped up in front of the dealer.

The other choice is to deal the cards in a clockwise manner which follows method 1 is reverse. The top card is 
flipped and 9 more cards are dealt to the dealer, then 10 to the player on his left, 10 to the player across from him,
and the last 10 cards to the player to his/her right. It should be clear that these two methods of dealing are 
simply the reverse of each other. 

The flipped up card **always** belongs to the dealer.

## Playing
Sueca is a trick-taking card game. A trick consists of each player playing one card and the player
with the highest ranking card winning the hand (it is common for one player on a team to collect
tricks won by either player). The highest ranking card in a trick is the highest trump card played,
if no trump cards were played then the highest ranking card in the suit led wins the trick. The 
winner of the previous trick leads the next trick.
The trump suit is determined by the card flipped over by the dealer.

### Card Ranking/Value
In all suits the cards are ranked as follows: 
* A (11 points)
* 7 (10 points)
* K (4 points)
* J (3 points)
* Q (2 points)
* 6 (0 points)
* 5 (0 points)
* 4 (0 points)
* 3 (0 points)
* 2 (0 points)
The ranking of the 7 and jack are common difficulties for newer players to understand.

## Scoring
There are 120 points among all the cards. 61 points wins the game, however it is possible to win
more than one game. The breakdown for games won is as follows:
* 61-90 points  (1 game)
* 91-118 points (2 games)
* 120 points    (3 games)
* All 10 tricks (4 games)

The difference between 3 and 4 games is whether one takes all the tricks. It is possible to have a trick
worth no points which allows for the rare but still possible triple game.

Two methods for match scoring are used. One is first team to 10 games wins. The other is played in 4 point
sets. The first team to win 4 points, wins the set. However, points do not carry over between sets.

## FAQ
* Can the dealer play the flipped up card on the first trick?
** Yes, the flipped up card is always a part of the dealer's hand. After the first trick he/she is allowed
to pick up the card if they choose. Therefore is is important for people to take note of the suit of the 
flipped up card immediately.
